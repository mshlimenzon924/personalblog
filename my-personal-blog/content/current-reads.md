# **What I'm Currently Reading ðŸ“š**

As some of you may know, I'm one of the co-presidents and co-founders of the **Cal Poly Classical Literature Club**, which I started with my best friend, Kate, during our freshman year. Weâ€™re both heavily involved in STEM fields, but we deeply missed the **intellectual stimulation of reading and analyzing literature**. What began as a small book club among friends quickly grew into an official campus organization.

The club meets **monthly** to discuss a selected book, diving into its themes and exploring how literature connects to our daily lives.

## **This Monthâ€™s Read: "My Year of Rest and Relaxation" by Ottessa Moshfegh**
ðŸ“– *A young woman embarks on a year-long, prescription-fueled hibernation in an attempt to escape the world.*

This month, our book club is reading *My Year of Rest and Relaxation*, a novel about a woman who, disillusioned with life, attempts to **sleep for an entire year** through a carefully crafted regimen of medications. Itâ€™s a dark, introspective read that explores themes of **escapism, privilege, and self-destruction**â€”perfect for thought-provoking discussion.

## **Other Books on My Shelf**
Aside from our book club selection, Iâ€™m currently juggling a few other books:

ðŸ“– **Bel Canto by Ann Patchett** â€“ A fascinating novel exploring the unexpected relationships that form between a group of hostages and their captors, including high-profile executives and politicians.

ðŸ“– **Good Omens by Neil Gaiman & Terry Pratchett** â€“ A fast-paced, comedic take on the apocalypse, filled with quirky characters and dark humor. After spending months reading *Crime and Punishment*, I needed something lightheartedâ€”and *Good Omens* is the perfect antidote.

## **Building My Japan Travel Reading List**
With my upcoming **trip to Japan**, Iâ€™m preparing for a **lot of time in transit**â€”roughly **2.5 hours of travel per day**. That means Iâ€™ll need a solid lineup of books to keep me entertained on long train rides.

I havenâ€™t finalized my reading list yet, but Iâ€™m looking for **engaging, fast-paced** reads to **keep morale high** during all the traveling. If you have any recommendations, drop them in the comments! ðŸ’¬

### **Final Thoughts**
Books have always been my favorite way to **transport myself somewhere else**â€”whether itâ€™s stepping into the mind of a complex character or immersing myself in a different time period or culture. A great story can **shift your perspective**, spark new ideas, and introduce ways of thinking you never considered before.

Let me know what you're reading this month! ðŸ’¬
