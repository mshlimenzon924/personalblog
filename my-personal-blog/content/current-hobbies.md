# What's Keeping Me Busy 🏋️‍♀️🎿🎨

One of my favorite things about life is that there’s always something new to learn, something exciting to try, and a new way to challenge myself. I’ve always been someone who jumps into hobbies full force, and right now, I’ve found myself in a cycle of activities that keep me active, creative, and constantly pushing my limits.

Here’s what I’ve been up to lately:

---

## 🏋️‍♀️ **Weightlifting – My Gym Routine**
I hit the gym **4-5 times a week**, rotating between **upper and lower body workouts**. Strength training has become a huge part of my routine — it's a consistent way I can move my body and get stronger every single week. It’s not just about the physical strength but the mental discipline too. Whether it's **leg presses, romain dead lifts, or even my upper-body circuits**, I love the structure of following a routine while still challenging myself to push a little further every time.

## 🎿 **Skiing – From Bunny Slopes to Blues**
Skiing has been a **huge** shift for me. Growing up, I only went skiing **every 4-5 years**, which meant that every time I went, I’d have to **start all over again** on the bunny slopes. I never really advanced beyond that, and skiing always felt like something reserved for "outdoorsy" people who grew up in mountain towns.

Fast forward to **college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo**, where apparently, **everyone is a skier** (I guess that’s what happens when  you surround yourself with friends from mountain towns). My friend group *adopted me* into the ski crew, and suddenly, I was hitting the slopes multiple times per season instead of once every few years. I finally invested in my **own ski gear** (check out a picture of me in my gear below), and for the first time, I’m **comfortably skiing blues** and slowly working my way up! Every trip is another step forward, and I love seeing myself improve at something I never thought I’d be good at.

## 💃 **Dancing – Hip Hop, Heels & Jazz**
Dancing is something I’ve *never* been naturally good at, but it’s quickly becoming one of my favorite hobbies. I started taking **hip hop and heels classes**, and it’s been an exciting challenge. One of my best friends is actually a **professional hip hop dancer and teacher**, so I’ve been taking classes with her whenever I get the chance.

I also signed up for a **jazz dance class**, and it’s been such a fun way to move and express myself. There’s something freeing about **learning choreography** and getting lost in the music — something that used to feel impossible for me. Music and rhythm haven’t always come naturally, but I love pushing myself to improve!

## 🚴‍♀️ **Spin Classes – Cycling for Fun**
I’ve been adding **spin classes** to my workout routine, and it’s been a surprisingly great way to mix things up. It’s high-energy, **keeps me moving**, and makes cardio way more enjoyable. There’s just something about **pedaling to the beat** of a good playlist that makes it a fun challenge instead of a chore.

One of the biggest reasons I love it? My instructor is amazing—she’s always hyping us up, making every class feel like a party, and pushing us to give it our all. It’s one of those workouts that I actually look forward to, and I love the motivation it gives me throughout the week.

## 🥾 **Hiking – Exploring the Outdoors**
Living in **San Luis Obispo** means there’s **no shortage of incredible hikes**. Whether it’s hitting the trails solo or going on group hikes with friends, **getting outside and exploring** is one of my favorite ways to clear my mind. Nothing beats **sunset hikes** or spontaneous weekend trips to nearby trails.

## 🎨 **Watercolor Painting – Café Sketching**
Lately, I’ve been *obsessed* with the idea of becoming one of those people who **sit in coffee shops and sketch** what’s around them. I’ve been practicing **watercolor painting**, and it’s been such a peaceful and rewarding hobby. I’ve been especially inspired by **Becky Cao**, an artist whose cozy, everyday sketches capture small moments in such a beautiful way.

I love the idea of documenting little **café moments, cityscapes, and people-watching scenes**, so I’ve been bringing my sketchbook with me more often and trying to make this a regular habit.

I’ve also started using watercolor paintings as **personalized gifts**—there’s something really special about giving someone a piece of art made just for them. The more I practice, the more I fall in love with the process, and I’m excited to keep improving.

## 📚 **Reading – My Constant Companion**
I’ve always been a **huge reader**, and right now, my bookshelf is *stacked* with new books. As the **President of the Cal Poly Classical Literature Club**, reading has become more than just a hobby—it’s a way to **connect with others** over shared stories and big ideas.

Some of my current reads include:
- **"Crime and Punishment"** by Fyodor Dostoevsky – our club’s January book of the month!
- **"Things Fall Apart"** by Chinua Achebe – a thought-provoking story of the downfall of the Igbo clan with the arrival of British colonialism.
- **"Breakfast at Tiffany's"** by Truman Capote – a true classic reminding us of the old romantic ideals of Hollywood, with some 1960s glitz and glam.

There’s something magical about **getting lost in a book**, and I love how reading can **transport me somewhere else and challenge my perspective**. Whether it’s fiction, philosophy, or a deep dive into a historical moment, I always have something on my nightstand.

## 🥋 **Past Hobbies – The Things I’ve Tried**
While these are my **current** hobbies, I’ve definitely gone through a lot of different phases over the years. Some of the more unique things I’ve done include:
- **Karate & Krav Maga** – Yep, I used to do martial arts!
- **Fencing** – During my summer in Portland. The precision and technique made it such an interesting challenge.
- **Logging** – *Yes, actual logging.* 🪓🪵 (It was a phase, okay? 😆)

It’s funny looking back at all the hobbies I’ve tried, but I love how each one has **taught me something new**.

## 🎯 **Final Thoughts**
Right now, my hobby rotation is a mix of **movement, creativity, and learning**, and I love the balance it brings to my life. Whether it’s **lifting heavy, hitting the slopes, learning to dance, painting in cafés, or getting lost in books**, I feel like each of these hobbies **adds something unique to my days**.
