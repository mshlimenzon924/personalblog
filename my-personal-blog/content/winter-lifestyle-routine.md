# 🌨️ **Refreshing My Routine in Winter** ✨

**Beating the cold, staying cozy, and keeping spirits high!**

☁️ **Winter in California is weird**—we’re not used to rain and cold, and **seasonal depression can hit hard**. That’s why I focus on **cozy habits, movement, and serotonin boosters** to make winter feel ✨ magical.

## ❄️☀️ **Morning Routine - Energize & Refresh** 🏋️‍♀️💪  
---

🌅 **Getting up is always the easiest part of the day** – As a morning person, I love starting my day early, especially since I have a **morning workout planned**.

✅ **Start the Day with Movement** 🏃‍♀️

Even when it’s cold, working out **kickstarts energy & mood**! Choose what works for you:  
- 🏋️‍♀️ **Gym Workouts** – Strength training 4-5x a week 💪  
- 💃 **Fun Classes** – Try dance, pilates, or yoga! ✨  
- 🚶‍♂️ **Outdoor Walks** – Even a **15-min morning walk** helps! 🌿

🎿 **Winter sports season!** – If possible, hit the ski slopes, go ice skating, or take a fun day trip to the mountains.

💧 **Hydrate first thing** – Cold air = **drier skin and dehydration**.
- Start your morning with **warm lemon water 🍋** or an **electrolyte drink**.  

🧴 **Moisturize, Moisturize, Moisturize** – Winter skin **needs extra hydration**!  
- ✨ **Thicker body lotion & face moisturizer** (The Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Balancing Gel Moisturizer will always be my favorite!)  
- 💄 **Lip balm** to prevent chapped lips (can even get some flavored yummy ones 🍓).  
- 🤲 **Hand cream** for soft, healthy skin (I've been obsessed with this goat milk lilac & jasmine hand cream I picked up at a farmer's market 🌸).

🍽 **A Warm, Nourishing Breakfast**

Winter gives you time to **get creative with breakfast**, adding **seasonal winter fruits 🍓🍎🍊** to make it even better!  
- 🍯 **Oatmeal with cinnamon, maple syrup, and nuts** – Try adding pomegranate seeds, sliced pears, or caramelized apples for a winter twist.  
- 🥑 **Avocado toast with chili flakes** – Top with blood orange slices or microgreens for extra flavor.  
- 🍳 **Scrambled eggs with veggies and toast** – Add roasted sweet potatoes, sautéed mushrooms, or spinach for warmth and nutrition.  
- 🍯 **Greek yogurt with winter fruit** – Mix in persimmons, cranberries, or figs with honey and granola.
