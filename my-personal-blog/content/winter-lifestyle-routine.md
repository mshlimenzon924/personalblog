# ❄️ How I Refresh My Routine in Winter

Winter is all about self-care, warm drinks, and cozy vibes. Here’s how I structure my daily routine.

## 🌅 Morning
- Start with a warm cup of **chai latte**.
- Journal for **5 minutes** to set daily intentions.

## 🌙 Evening
- Read a **comfort book**.
- Use **aromatherapy** before bed.

Winter is my time to slow down and embrace comfort!
